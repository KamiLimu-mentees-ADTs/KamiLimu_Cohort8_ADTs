# Stack
A `Stack` is an Abstract Data Type that follows the `First In Last Out` principle.

You can only insert or remove a data item from one end of the stack. Think of it like a pile of books in a box; you could only place books into the box, or pick them, from the top.

### Terminologies
- Push - The action of adding data to the stack
- Pop - The action of removing data from the stack
- Peek - Checking the data item currently at the top of the stack, without removing it.

### Methods to implement
- isEmpty() - Checks if the stack is empty
- isFull() - Checks if the stack is fully occupied, according to the size you defined
- peek() - Check the item currently at the top of the stack
- pop() - Remove and return the item at the top of the stack
- push() - Add an item to the stack
