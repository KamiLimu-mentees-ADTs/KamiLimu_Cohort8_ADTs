# Queue
A `queue` is an Abstract Data Type that follows the `First In First Out` principle.

It maintains two pointers; on at the front and another at the back. A queue has two openings. Think of it as a literal queue of people standing in line at the cashier or buffet. The first one in the queue is the first to get the relevant service.

### Terminologies
- Rear - The entry point of new data into the queue
- Front - The exit point of data from the queue
- Enqueue - Adding a data item to the rear end
- Dequeue - Removing a data item from the front
- Peek - Checking the data item at the front of the queue, without removing it

### Methods to implement
- isEmpty() - Checks if the queue is empty
- isFull() - Checks if the queue is full
- Enqueue() - Adds data to the queue
- Dequeue() - Removes data from the queue
- Peek() - Prints the item at the front of the queue
